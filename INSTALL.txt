=========================
Installation instructions
=========================

You may download the latest version of this tutorial here:

  https://github.com/dnouri/pyramid-tutorial/zipball/master

Alternatively, clone with git::

  $ git clone git@github.com:dnouri/pyramid-tutorial.git


C compiler
==========

If you're on Debian or Ubuntu, you can install a C compiler with::

  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential

If you're using Mac OSX, you need to install Xcode:
https://developer.apple.com/xcode/


Python 2.6 or 2.7 and header files
==================================

On Debian or Ubuntu::

  $ sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev

Alternatively, compile from source::

  [chrism@vitaminf ~]$ cd ~
  [chrism@vitaminf ~]$ mkdir tmp
  [chrism@vitaminf ~]$ mkdir opt
  [chrism@vitaminf ~]$ cd tmp
  [chrism@vitaminf tmp]$ wget \
         http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.4/Python-2.6.4.tgz
  [chrism@vitaminf tmp]$ tar xvzf Python-2.6.4.tgz
  [chrism@vitaminf tmp]$ cd Python-2.6.4
  [chrism@vitaminf Python-2.6.4]$ ./configure \
          --prefix=$HOME/opt/Python-2.6.4
  [chrism@vitaminf Python-2.6.4]$ make; make install

Once these steps are performed, the Python interpreter will be
invokable via ``$HOME/opt/Python-2.6.4/bin/python`` from a shell
prompt.


Install virtualenv
==================

Try to see if you have virtualenv installed::

  $ virtualenv . --no-site-packages

If it says "command not found", you'll have to install virtualenv
first, and re-run the command above after you completed installation.
The virtualenv installation instructions vary between operating
systems.


Install virtualenv on Debian or Ubuntu
--------------------------------------

If you don't have virtualenv, and you're on Debian or Ubuntu, do::

  $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv


Install virtualenv on other systems
-----------------------------------

Download this file and run it with your Python interpreter to create
the virtualenv::

  $ curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/virtualenv/master/virtualenv.py
  $ python virtualenv.py .

If this doesn't work, try::

  $ sudo easy_install virtualenv  # run this command as root

and then create the virtualenv as normally.


virtualenv's bin/python
=======================

After installing the virtualenv package, and creating your virtualenv
directory, you should have a Python executable inside the ``bin/``
directory.  Try to run it::

  $ bin/python
  Python 2.7.2+ (default, Oct  4 2011, 20:06:09) 
  [GCC 4.6.1] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> 


Install Pyramid
===============

There's also ``bin/pip``, which you'll use to install Pyramid into
your new virtualenv::

  $ bin/pip install pyramid
  Downloading/unpacking pyramid
    Downloading pyramid-1.3.2.tar.gz (2.4Mb): 2.4Mb downloaded
    Running setup.py egg_info for package pyramid
  ...
  Successfully installed pyramid Chameleon Mako WebOb repoze.lru zope.interface zope.deprecation venusian translationstring PasteDeploy MarkupSafe
  Cleaning up...

Great, you now have Pyramid installed!


Run our first Pyramid web app
=============================

Our first example application consists of a single Python file ::

  $ bin/python ex1_hello/hello.py
  Server started at http://localhost:8080

Now you can open http://localhost:8080/hello/world in your browser,
and you should see "Hello world!".

Press Ctrl-C to stop the application.

If everything worked so far, continue with reading the contents of
``ex1_hello/hello.py``.


Should the instructions not work
================================

These instructions apply to Linux and Mac OSX systems.  If you're on
Windows, you may want to refer to the Pyramid installation
instructions online:
http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/install.html

If installation doesn't work, and you're sitting in the live tutorial,
find a colleague who has a working installation and follow along with
them.

If you're not in a hurry, but still can't get installation to work,
consider installing a recent Ubuntu in a virtual machine.
Installation on Debian or Ubuntu is considerably easier than on other
systems.
