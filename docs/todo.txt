Bigger tasks
============

- (API-) Documentation (work in progress)

- A pluggable settings screen for content items for things like 'allow
  discussion', 'default page'.

- Allow in-page macros for things like 'table of contents' (for
  listing all contained pages in a TOC style).  See
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kotti/Kck0kYK3EkQ/YCu45JsJbI8J

- Add an item to the control panel that lists a list of logged
  application exceptions.  Possibly other introspectable features,
  like version numbers etc.

- Multilingual support (in core or kotti_multilingual add-on?), probably
  based on annotations.

Have an idea for this list?  Discuss at
http://groups.google.com/group/kotti or #kotti on IRC.

Smaller tasks
=============

- Add a subscribe decorator to kotti.events, so that you can decorate
  your functions instead of having to manually append to
  kotti.events.listeners[object]

- Many of the templates used in 'kotti/views/edit.py' have some legacy
  cruft in them.  Clean up.

- Move more navigation related functionality out of TemplateAPI and
  into snippets.

- Make a proper LICENSE.txt file, listing all licenses of components we use.

- Define and document annotation "best practice".  I.e. add-on "namespaces"?

- Define and document control panel "best practice" for add-ons.

- Add ordering of children and hide/show(Content.in_navigation) to the contents
  view.

Upstream tasks
==============

- Release deform 0.9.6 to be able to use Button(css_class="btn-foo") feature.
