"""Some explanation on how the imagedrawer ajax works. The
workflow is described here.

As a principle, we want a minimum number of requests. So, each
request can aggregate various pieces of information in its
response, so that the client has everything at hand without
the need for consequent requests. The responses are json format.

None of these requests should be cacheable at all.

1. User is editing a page. She presses the 'image' button on the
   tinymce toolbar.

  - Client calls "drawer_dialog_view.html".

  - The view returns:
        {
        dialog_snippet: ...the html of the dialog
        images_info: ...the first batch of the image listing
            (in case, the initial image source needs one.
            Otherwise, it is missing. Since the server selects
            the initial image source, it knows if the images_info
            is needed and provides it. This saves one ajax
            request for the client.)
        error: ... explicitely raise an error
        }

2. User is scrolling to the next batch of images.

  - Client calls "drawer_data_view.html".

  - The view returns:
        {
        images_info: ...the selected batch of the image listing
        error: ... explicitely raise an error
        }


3. User is changing the data source or filtering (= update).

  - Client calls "drawer_data_view.html".

  - The view returns:
        {
        images_info: ...the selected batch of the image listing
        error: ... explicitely raise an error
        }


4. User is uploading a file.

  - Client posts to "drawer_upload_view.html".

  - The file content is passed in to the view as
    the "file" parameter. This file is
    saved on the server side, thumbnail generated etc.

  - The view returns:
        {
        upload_image_info: ...information aboutt the succesfully
                    uploaded file, in the same record format as used
                    in the data views.
