Getting Started with Pyramid
============================

Pyramid is a web framework for Python 2 and 3. This tutorial gives a
Python 2/3-compatible, high-level tour of the major features.

This hands-on tutorial covers "a little about a lot": practical
introductions to the most common facilities. Fun, fast-paced, and most
certainly not aimed at experts.
