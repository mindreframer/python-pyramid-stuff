Creating a Custom UX for Pyramid
================================

In this series of steps we build the essence of the user experience
(UX) with placeholders for the logic and data.

Goals
=====

- Simplest possible Pyramid screen

- Using unit tests and WebTest to speed up development

- Templating with Chameleon and ZPT

- Using macros and "layouts" for templating productivity

- Static resources

- AJAX via the JSON renderer

The Workflow
============

Many projects have a certain workflow, starting with a customer who
usually needs to see something in order to understand and agree.
Usually the "UI person" on the team iterates at this point,
gets a working prototype in place, then the logic gets filled in.

This tutorial models such a workflow. In this first section,
we show how a human, without deep Pyramid architectural knowledge,
can make a working prototype of the various screens in Projector.
