        # should be removed, and the union of actions in new_added and
        # committed_added should be added.  But note that when there are
        # individual actions within the removed or added sets that compare
        # equal, the actions are keyed in the set only by (oid,index) and their
        # __eq__ doesn't take into account the action type.  For example, there
        # might be two different actions which compare equal in the different
        # sets: a reindex action for oid 1 in the new_removed set and an
        # unindex action for the same oid in the committed_removed set.
        #
        # We could create an 'action_union' function which would return a union
        # of two sets composed of actions.  When two actions in the sets
        # compare otherwise equal it would return the "real" action or it would
        # conflict for two actions that compare equal but which are mutually
        # incompatible.  For example, if we had an index action for oid 1 in
        # new_removed, and a reindex action for oid 1 in committed_removed, the
        # index action would be returned (the reindex action would be
        # discarded).  There would be no conflict in this case. On the other
        # hand, the action_union function might raise a ConflictError if it
        # can't determine what to do; an example of a case where action_union
        # wouldn't know what to do is if there's an index action for oid 1 in
        # new_removed, and an unindex action for oid 1 in committed_removed.
        #
        # In practice, however, this strategy plays hell with undo.  For
        # example:
        #
        #   T1    unindex lots of objects
        #   T2    undo T1
        #   T3    process actions in T1 queue
        #
        # I had originally thought that all undo operations would call
        # _p_resolveConflict here, but it's not true; if an undo can just copy
        # an old record forward, it does so.  So in the sequence of events
        # above, T1 will commit OK, and then T2 will commit OK (without calling
        # _p_resolveConflict), and we'll be left with a conflict resolution
        # problem in the (non-undo) T3.
        #
        # If T3 causes conflict as above, the old state (T1) will contain lots
        # of unindex actions, and neither the new state (T3) nor committed
        # state (from T2) will contain any actions.  If we used the
        # "action_union" strategy, all of the actions would be perfectly
        # resolveable, and we'd wind up returning a state without any actions
        # in it.  However, this would also be completely wrong, because we
        # don't actually *want* the transaction state resulting from the
        # unindex actions; instead, we want T3 to conflict with T2, so the
        # executions of the unindex actions fail, because we don't actually
        # want the objects unindexed anymore.
        #
        # Such a problem is probably generalizable to any two transactions
        # which simultaneously remove actions that conflict, but I noticed it
        # in the undo case, so the description above focuses on it.  Also, the
        # only thing that removes actions is an actions processor thread.
        # Since there's generally only going to be one of those, undo will
        # typically be the only time an action is removed as the result of an
        # action taken by a human that has a possibility of the remove
        # conflicting with another transaction (the actions processor).
