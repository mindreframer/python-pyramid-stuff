Scenario
========

Pyramid excels at building web applications in several fashions. Like
Pylons before it, Pyramid can build traditional routes-oriented RDBMS
applications using SQLAlchemy. Unlike other RDBMS based web frameworks,
Pyramid is also very well equipped to easily build content-oriented
applications familiar from the world of Zope and Plone.

Since this is a tutorial for the Plone Conference,
we are choosing a scenario that plays to Pyramid's strengths in
content-style applications. Namely, a hierarchical project management
system where you can assign tasks to teams.

For the purposes of this tutorial, the application is named *Projector.*
